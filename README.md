Repository of code for Spring 2020 undergraduate research project experimenting with variations and visualizations
of the Yard Sale Model.

Project currently on hold after disruption due to COVID-19.

To get started, we first try to use the Mesa agent-based modeling framework for Python 3+ to implement variations.

Variations:
1) Default
2) Weights
3) Gifts
